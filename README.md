# API_ENDPOINT_with_GPD
Creating an API endpoint which will have a GET, POST and DELETE method.

1. Initialize a Node.js project:
   npm init -y

2. Install Express:
   npm install express
   
3. Create main file. ex: app.js

4. To run your Node.js application, execute the following command:
   node mainfilename.js

Your API will be accessible at 'http://localhost:3000'. You can use tools like 'curl' or Postman to test the endpoints.

**To access the defined routes, use the following URLs:**

To retrieve a resource (GET): 'http://localhost:3000/resource/1'

To create a resource (POST): 'http://localhost:3000/resource'

To delete a resource (DELETE): 'http://localhost:3000/resource/1'
